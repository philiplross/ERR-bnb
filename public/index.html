                  able to give him insight like never before. He loves exploring new neighborhoods in san diego being origanlaly from chicago. 
                  San Diego is such a vibrate city with amazing neighborhoods with a little something for everyone.
                  Some of the areas he likes to vist it are costal towns like, Pacific beach, La Jolla, Encinitas, and Carlsbad where he likes to go snorkling or diving.
                  For food Kearney Mesa is his jam wich is like san diego's little "China Town", also San Ysidro for great Mexican food next to the border.
                  When he's looking to have some fun he usualy romps around Northpark, Ronaldo, or Golden Hill.
                  
                  As phil likes to say "Just remeber what ever you end up doing it will still be 80 degrees in decmeber while you do it, so you gotta love San Diego!"
